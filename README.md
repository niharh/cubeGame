# cubeGame

To open this file, open unity, then you need to run the game. To control the cube, use W to move forward, A and D to move left and right, and S to move backwards
(if you get stuck). This project took me 3/4 hours because I had to learn C# to code the player movements and I needed to get used to the unity UI.
